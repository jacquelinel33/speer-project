Section 1

* User registration using unique username and a password
* User login (Including session maintenance using any means you're comfortable with)
* Unit tests for these basic methods


Section 2

Start *only* once the Basic Functionality is complete. Complete these *in the order specified*

* Chat with other users
* Create, read, update, delete tweet (Twitter doesn't support update, can you?)
* Unit/Integration tests for *all* endpoints you've built so far (Basic & Extended Functionality)

Section 3

Start *only* once section 1 and 2 functionality is complete. The following endpoints are for bonus points, and you SHOULD NOT attempt them until all previous requirements are completed.

* Like/unlike a tweet
* Retweet
* Threading

If you can implement message queues/ real-time queries then go ahead and make a feature thatâ€™s not listed above. You can skip section 2 and 3 of the tests if you have an idea for these.
